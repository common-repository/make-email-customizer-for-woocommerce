WooCommerce Email Customizer plugin allows you to fully customize the styling, colors, logo and text in the emails sent from your WooCommerce store.

== Description ==

Create Beautiful Customized WooCommerce Emails:
Email Customizer enables full customization of your WooCommerce emails. Customize colors, header & footer format, add custom links, link to your social networks, and now even customize what the email says. You no longer need to be a developer to do this.

Currently customization is something that only a developer can do by going into the code and editing the template files, which isn't really an option for a non-programmer. We wanted to give you an environment that is simple to use, gives you a live preview of your customizations, and can send a test email when you are done. That's what Email Customizer for WooCommerce does.

The plugin also adds functionality to your WooCommerce Orders page so you are able to open a preview of any of the email templates (New Order, Invoice, Processing Order, etc), and send/resend that email to your customer or yourself.

Email Customizer for WooCommerce has made managing the email communications sent from our store much simpler and more beautiful - making our whole operation look and sounds as solid as it is. We think it can do the same for you.

Great For
* Customizing of the  the styling, colors, header & footer format, add custom links, link to your social networks, and now even customize what the email says.
